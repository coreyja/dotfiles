# Coreyja's dotfiles

My dotfiles!

This started out as a fork from https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles but diverged enough that I cut the fork tie at some point.

Notably I run my dotfiles where my homedir is under git, so not aliasing/copying is required or provided here

Here are some blog posts I've written about my dotfiles:
